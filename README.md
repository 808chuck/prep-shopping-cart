# Shopping Cart
You are tasked to build and design the front-end of a new highly-sophisicated locally-built powerhouse meme-tastic shopping cart named... **ShoppingCart.io**.

[Demo to Invision](https://invis.io/S64F3KF2X)

## Your Tasks
1. Reproduce the layout.
2. Generate the items in the cart with the data given to you. **Item data should not be hardcoded!**
3. Work and finish `version 1` before moving onto `version 2`.

*note: you can use the `cart.svg` file as your image, just include it in your HTML markup*

## Getting Started
1. Fork and Clone this repository.
2. Build this project with good file structure in mind.
